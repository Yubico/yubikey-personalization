.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Set the AES key, user ID and other settings in a YubiKey.  For the complete
explanation of the meaning of all parameters, see the reference
manual:
.URL "http://yubico.com/files/YubiKey_manual-2.0.pdf" "YubiKey manual"
.TP
\fB\-1\fR
change the first configuration.  This is the default and is
normally used for true OTP generation.  In this configuration,
the option flag \fB-oappend-cr\fR is set by default.
.TP
\fB\-2\fR
change the second configuration.  This is for YubiKey II only and is
then normally used for static key generation.  In this configuration,
the option flags \fB-oappend-cr\fR, \fB-ostatic-ticket\fR, \fB-ostrong-pw1\fR,
\fB-ostrong-pw2\fR and \fB-oman-update\fR are set by default.
.TP
\fB-z\fR
delete configuration in selected slot
.TP
\fB\-s\fIfile\fR
save configuration to file instead of key.
(if file is -, send to stdout)
.TP
\fB\-i\fIfile\fR
read configuration from file.
(if file is -, read from stdin)
Configuration import is only valid for the ycfg format.
.TP
\fB\-f\fIformat\fR
format to be used with \fB-s\fR and \fB-i\fR.
Valid options are \fBycfg\fR and \fBlegacy\fR.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR[\fIxxx\fR]
the AES secret key as a 32 (or 40 for OATH-HOTP/HMAC CHAL-RESP) char hex value (not modhex) (none to prompt for key on stdin)
If \fB\-a\fR is not used a random key will be generated.
.TP
\fB\-c\fIxxx\fR
A 12 char hex value (not modhex) to use as access code for
programming.
NOTE: this does NOT SET the access code, that's done with \fB-oaccess\fI=\fR.
.TP
\fB\-o\fIoption\fR
change configuration option.  Possible option arguments are
.RS
.TP
\fBfixed\fR=\fIfffffffffff\fR
The modhex \fIpublic identity\fR of the YubiKey, 0-32 characters long (encoding
up to 16 bytes).
It's possible to give the identity in hex as well, just prepend the
value with `h:'. The fixed part is emitted before the OTP when the
button on the YubiKey is pressed. It can be used as an identifier for
the user, for example.
.TP
\fBuid\fR=\fIuuuuuu\fR
The uid part of the generated OTP, also called \fIprivate identity\fR, in hex.
Must be 12 characters long. The uid is 6 bytes of static data that is included
(encrypted) in every OTP, and is used to validate that an OTP was in fact encrypted
with the AES key shared between the YubiKey and the validation service. It cannot
be used to identify the YubiKey as it is only readable to those that know
the AES key.
.TP
\fBaccess\fR=\fIfffffffffff\fR
New hex access code to set. Must be 12 characters long.
If an access code is set, it will be required for subsequent reprogramming of the YubiKey.
.TP
\fBoath-imf\fR=\fIxxx\fR
Set OATH Initial Moving Factor. This is the initial counter value for the YubiKey.
This should be a value between 0 and 1048560, evenly dividable by 16.
.TP

.RE
.SH Ticket flags
.TP
[\-]\fBtab-first\fR
Send a tab character as the first character.  This is usually used to move
to the next input field.
.TP
[\-]\fBappend-tab1\fR
Send a tab character between the fixed part and the one-time password
part. This is useful if you have the fixed portion equal to the user
name and two input fields that you navigate between using tab.
.TP
[\-]\fBappend-tab2\fR
Send a tab character as the last character.
.TP
[\-]\fBappend-delay1\fR
Add a half-second delay before sending the one-time password part.
This option is only valid for firmware 1.x and 2.x.
.TP
[\-]\fBappend-delay2\fR
Add a half-second delay after sending the one-time password part.
This option is only valid for firmware 1.x and 2.x.
.TP
[\-]\fBappend-cr\fR
Send a carriage return after sending the one-time password part.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.0 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBprotect-cfg2\fR
When written to configuration 1, block later updates to configuration
2.  When written to configuration 2, prevent configuration 1 from
having the lock bit set.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.1 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBoath-hotp\fR
Set OATH-HOTP mode rather than YubiKey mode.  In this mode, the token
functions according to the OATH-HOTP standard.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.2 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBchal-resp\fR
Set challenge-response mode.
.SH Configuration flags
[\-]\fBsend-ref\fR
Send a reference string of all 16 modhex characters before the fixed
part.  This can not be combined with the \fB-ostrong-pw2\fR flag.
.TP
[\-]\fBpacing-10ms\fR
Add a 10ms delay between key presses.
.TP
[\-]\fBpacing-20ms\fR
Add a 20ms delay between key presses.
.TP
[\-]\fBstatic-ticket\fR
Output a fixed string rather than a one-time password.  The password
is still based on the AES key and should be hard to guess and
impossible to remember.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 1.x firmware only\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBticket-first\fR
Send the one-time password rather than the fixed part first.
.TP
[\-]\fBallow-hidtrig\fR
Allow trigger through HID/keyboard by pressing caps-, num or
scroll-lock twice.  Not recommended for security reasons.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.0 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBshort-ticket\fR
Limit the length of the static string to max 16 digits.  This flag
only makes sense with the \fB-ostatic-ticket\fR option.  When
\fB-oshort-ticket\fR is used without \fB-ostatic-ticket\fR it will
program the YubiKey in "scan-code mode", in this mode the key sends
the contents of fixed, uid and key as raw keyboard scancodes.  For
example, by using the fixed string \fIh:8b080f0f122c9a12150f079e\fR in
this mode it will send \fIHello World!\fR on a qwerty keyboard.  This
mode sends raw scan codes, so output will differ between keyboard layouts.
.TP
[\-]\fBstrong-pw1\fR
Upper-case the two first letters of the output string.  This is for
compatibility with legacy systems that enforce both uppercase and
lowercase characters in a password and does not add any security.
.TP
[\-]\fBstrong-pw2\fR
Replace the first eight characters of the modhex alphabet with the
numbers 0 to 7.  Like \fB-ostrong-pw1\fR, this is intended to support
legacy systems.
.TP
[\-]\fBman-update\fR
Enable user-initiated update of the static password.  Only makes sense
with the \fB-ostatic-ticket\fR option.  This is only valid for firmware
2.x.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.1 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBoath-hotp8\fR
When set, generate an 8-digit HOTP rather than a 6-digit one.
.TP
[\-]\fBoath-fixed-modhex1\fR
When set, the first byte of the fixed part is sent as modhex.
.TP
[\-]\fBoath-fixed-modhex2\fR
When set, the first two bytes of the fixed part is sent as modhex.
.TP
[\-]\fBoath-fixed-modhex\fR
When set, the fixed part is sent as modhex.
.TP
\fBoath-id=m:OOTTUUUUUUUU\fR
Configure OATH token id with a provided value.  See description of
this option under the 2.2 section for details, but note that a YubiKey
2.1 key can't report its serial number and thus a token identifier value
must be specified.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.2 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBchal-yubico\fR
Yubico OTP challenge-response mode.
.TP
[\-]\fBchal-hmac\fR
Generate HMAC-SHA1 challenge responses.
.TP
[\-]\fBhmac-lt64\fR
Calculate HMAC on less than 64 bytes input.  Whatever is in the last byte
of the challenge is used as end of input marker (backtracking from end of payload).
.TP
[\-]\fBchal-btn-trig\fR
The YubiKey will wait for the user to press the key (within 15 seconds) before
answering the challenge.
.TP
[\-]\fBserial-btn-visible\fR
The YubiKey will emit its serial number if the button is pressed during power-up.
This option is only valid for the 2.x firmware line.
.TP
[\-]\fBserial-usb-visible\fR
The YubiKey will indicate its serial number in the USB iSerial field.
This option is not available in the 3.0 and 3.1 firmwares.
.TP
[\-]\fBserial-api-visible\fR
The YubiKey will allow its serial number to be read using an API call.
.TP
\fBoath-id[=m:OOTTUUUUUUUU]\fR
Configure OATH token id with a provided value, or if used without a value use the
standard YubiKey token identifier.

The standard OATH token id for a Yubico YubiKey is (modhex) OO=ub, TT=he,
(decimal) UUUUUUUU=serial number.

The reason for the decimal serial number is to make it easy for humans to correlate
the serial number on the back of the YubiKey to an entry in a list of associated
tokens for example.  Other encodings can be accomplished using the appropriate
oath-fixed-modhex options.

Note that the YubiKey must be programmed to allow reading its serial number,
otherwise automatic token id creation is not possible.

See section "5.3.4 - OATH-HOTP Token Identifier" of the
.URL "http://yubico.com/files/YubiKey_manual-2.0.pdf" "YubiKey manual"
for further details.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.3 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBuse-numeric-keypad\fR
Send scancodes for numeric keypad keypresses when sending digits - helps with some
keyboard layouts.
This option is only valid for the 2.x firmware line.
.TP
[\-]\fBfast-trig\fR
Faster triggering when only configuration 1 is available.
This option is always in effect on firmware versions 3.0 and above.
.TP
[\-]\fBallow-update\fR
Allow updating of certain parameters in a configuration at a later time.
.TP
[\-]\fBdormant\fR
Hides/unhides a configuration stored in a YubiKey.
.TP
\fBYubiKey 2.4/3.1 firmware and above\fR
.TP
[\-]\fBled-inv\fR
Inverts the behaviour of the led on the YubiKey.

.SH OATH-HOTP Mode
When using OATH-HOTP mode, a HMAC key of 160 bits (20 bytes, 40 chars of hex)
can be supplied with \fB\-a\fR.
.PP

.SH Challenge-response Mode
In \fBCHAL-RESP\fR mode, the token will NOT generate any keypresses when the button
is pressed (although it is perfectly possible to have one slot with a keypress-generating
configuration, and the other in challenge-response mode).  Instead, a program capable of
sending USB HID feature reports to the token must be used to send it a challenge, and
read the response.

.SH Modhex
Modhex is a way of writing hex digits where the \(lqdigits\(rq are
chosen for being in the same place on most keyboard layouts.
.TP
To convert from hex to modhex, you can use
.RS
tr "[0123456789abcdef]" "[cbdefghijklnrtuv]"
