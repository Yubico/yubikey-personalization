Has ProducId 0x110, 0x111 or 0x112 depending on mode (see the notes about
-m and device_config).

Use SLOT_NDEF to emit slot 1 as NDEF or SLOT_NDEF2 to emit slot 2.
This also adds the function yk_write_ndef2() that takes a slot parameter.

** Add -m flag for ykpersonalize, set usb mode of YubiKey NEO.
0 means pure YubiKey mode, 1 means pure CCID mode and 2 means YubiKey/CCID
composite mode. Add 80 to set EJECT_FLAG.
To use this with the api, see the functions:
ykp_alloc_device_config(), ykp_free_device_config(), ykp_set_device_mode(),
ykp_set_device_chalresp_timeout(), ykp_set_device_autoeject_time() and
yk_write_device_config().

Take an 90 character string describing 45 scancodes. See man page for more
info. To use this with the api see yk_write_scan_map().

** In the api add ykp_ndef_as_text() to export the text from a YK_NDEF structure.

** Higher timeout for configuration writes as in particular swap can take
longer than 600 ms.

with a key.

** Fixed functions for NDEF writing, adding:
ykp_ndef_alloc(), ykp_ndef_free() and ykp_set_ndef_access_code()

yk_write_ndef() there.
Change return values from ndef_construct_*() functions to make them
consistent with the rest of the library.

** Fixed a crash bug when the library was called from different threads.

** Check return code from libusb_init() so we avoid crashing there.
Also use a usb context instead of relying on default.

** Fix numerous warnings.

DORMANT flag that's settable/removable if ALLOW_UPDATE is set
USE_NUMERIC_KEYPAD flag for sending the OATH OTP using keypad scan codes instead
FAST_TRIG flag for faster triggering of slot one if slot two is empty

** Change the library around some to make the 2.3 features available.
Use ykp_alloc() instead of ykp_create_config().
Use ykp_configure_version() instead of ykp_configure_for() to set the version.
Use ykp_configure_command() instead of ykp_configure_for() to set slot.
