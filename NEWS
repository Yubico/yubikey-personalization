Yubikey-personalize NEWS -- History of user-visible changes.     -*- outline -*-

* Version 1.8.1 (unreleased)

* Version 1.8.0 (released 2012-09-28)

** Added ./configure --enable-gcc-warnings to enable a lot of warnings.

** Added Continuous integration at travis-ci
(http://travis-ci.org/#!/Yubico/yubikey-personalization)

** Added yk_challenge_response() function for doing challenge response
with a key.

** Fixed functions for NDEF writing, adding:
ykp_ndef_alloc(), ykp_ndef_free() and ykp_set_ndef_access_code()
also providing compatible name YK_NDEF in ykcore.h and exporting
yk_write_ndef() there.
Change return values from ndef_construct_*() functions to make them
consistent with the rest of the library.

** Fixed a crash bug when the library was called from different threads.

** Check return code from libusb_init() so we avoid crashing there.
Also use a usb context instead of relying on default.

** Fix numerous warnings.

** Fix compilation in MSVC2010.

* Version 1.7.0 (released 2012-06-07)

** Add support for new features in YubiKey 2.3:
ALLOW_UPDATE flag that allows updating of configuration in slots.
Update command (-u) to do update of existing config.
Swap command (-x) to swap contents of two updatable slots
DORMANT flag that's settable/removable if ALLOW_UPDATE is set
USE_NUMERIC_KEYPAD flag for sending the OATH OTP using keypad scan codes instead
FAST_TRIG flag for faster triggering of slot one if slot two is empty

** Change the library around some to make the 2.3 features available.
Use ykp_alloc() instead of ykp_create_config().
Use ykp_configure_version() instead of ykp_configure_for() to set the version.
Use ykp_configure_command() instead of ykp_configure_for() to set slot.
Use yk_write_command() instead of yk_write_config().

The new commands doesn't set any default configuration at all.

** Add library support for the YubiKey NEO beta
ykp_construct_ndef_uri() for preparing a URI to write.
ykp_construct_ndef_text() for preparing a text to write.
yk_write_ndef() to write the constructed NDEF.

** Add support for the YubiKey NEO beta
Writing NDEF URI with -n http://example.com/foo/
Writing NDEF Text record with -t example

** Windows: Bump yubico-c dependency to version 1.9.

** Windows: Build fixes related to self checks.

** Bugfixes :

*** Fixed a crash in the self test on 64-bit platforms.

*** Fixed a build error in self tests when "-z muldefs" is not supported.

for OATH-HOTP.

that support it (OATH-HOTP and HMAC challenge response).

** OATH-HOTP usability improvements.

** Serial number of YubiKey (2.2+) is shown with `ykpersonalize -v'.

** Make `configure' detect FreeBSD 8 libusb implementation.

* Version 1.4.1 (released 2011-01-19)
** Restore OATH-HOTP symbols for LIBYKPERS_1.0.
Accidentally moved to LIBYKPERS_1.4 in 1.4.0.

* Version 1.4.0 (released 2011-01-17)
** Add support for new features in YubiKey 2.2.
Most notably challenge-response, but also serial number retrieval.

** Stricter argument parsing, to help user avoid configuration surprises.

** Bugfixes :
*** Ask kernel to detach USB HID driver with libusb 0.1 too.

*** Properly reject keys (-a) with upper case hex, instead of just ignoring
those bits.

It is better now, but not perfect.

the YubiKey II.

** Have ykpersonalize show the new configuration and prompt.
This makes it possible for the user to prevent incorrect configurations.

** Rename installed library to "libykpers-1" and place
** installed header files in sub-directory ykpers-1/.
From now on we promise to retain API and ABI under this name forever.
The shared library will be installed as /usr/lib/libykpers-1.so and
the header files into /usr/include/ykpers-1/.  If there is ever an
incompatible API or ABI change in the future, it will be released as a
a new library libykpers-2 with header files in ykpers-2/.

** Add pkg-config script "ykpers-1".
To learn which flags to build the applications that uses the library,
use "pkg-config --cflags --libs ykpers-1".
