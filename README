Installation of the Yubikey Personalization package
===================================================

Yubikey Personalization
-----------------------

The YubiKey Personalization package contains a library and command
line tool used to personalize (i.e., set a AES key) YubiKeys.

Documentation
-------------

The complete reference manual on the YubiKey is required reading if
you want to understand the entire picture and what each parameter
does.  Download it from http://www.yubico.com/

Dependencies
------------

Getting and installing dependencies depends on your operating systems,
we give example for some flavours.  If you know how to install
dependencies on other systems, let us know.  Debian hints should apply
to Debian derivatives as well, including Ubuntu.

Yubico-c is needed, see: https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-c/

  Debian:           apt-get install libyubikey-dev

Pkg-config simplify finding other dependencies, see:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config

  Debian:           apt-get install pkg-config

Yubikey-personalization depends on libusb or libusb-1, so you will
have to get it.  We recommend using libusb-1.

  Debian libusb-1:  apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
  Debian libusb:    apt-get install libusb-dev
  Fedora:           yum install libusb-devel

The JSON library is an optional dependency, see:
https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki

  Debian:           apt-get install libjson0-dev

You need json-c version 0.10 or later to get pretty printing of JSON
output.  This project will build with version 0.9 too, but will not
pretty print the JSON output.

License
-------

The project is licensed under a BSD license.  See the file COPYING for
exact wording.  For any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in
this package note that the range specifies every single year in that
closed interval.

Building from Git
-----------------

Skip to the next section if you are using an official packaged
version.

You may check out the sources using Git with the following command:

-----------
  git clone https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization.git
-----------

This will create a directory 'yubikey-personalization'.  Enter the directory:

-----------
  cd yubikey-personalization
-----------


When building from source Yubikey-personaliztion depends on link:http://asciidoc.org/INSTALL.html[asciidoc] to build it's manpage.

Autoconf, automake and libtool must be installed.

Generate the build system using:

-----------
  autoreconf --install
-----------

Building
--------

The build system uses Autoconf, to set up the build system run:

-----------
  ./configure
-----------

Then build the code, run the self-test and install the binaries:

-----------
  make check install
-----------

Using
-----

WARNING: By using this tool you will destroy the AES key in your
YubiKey.  This prevents it from being useful against Yubico's
validation server.  It is possible to upload a new AES key to Yubico,
using a random YubiKey prefix, to restore it.  But it is not possible
to get back your old yubikey prefix if you decide to re-program your
YubiKey.

IMPORTANT: When running any of the utils that need to access the YubiKey 
you will either need to run as root, or you will have to have made sure 
that the current user has permission to access the device. These 
permissions can be set up by copying the udev rules files 
(https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization/blob/master/69-yubikey.rules[69-yubikey.rules] 
and https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization/blob/master/70-yubikey.rules[70-yubikey.rules]) to /etc/udev/rules.d/

With that out of the way, here is how you would program a YubiKey with
an all-zero AES key and a dummy prefix:

-----------
$ ./ykpersonalize -1 -ofixed=cccccccccccc -a00000000000000000000000000000000
Firmware version 1.3.1 Touch level 9840 Program sequence 10

Using the "ykparse" tool from the yubico-c package, you can check that
the OTPs are correct.  For example:

-----------
$ ykparse 00000000000000000000000000000000 ccccccccccccdkrkedgchtlfefghcekefhlifbchijrd
warning: overlong token, ignoring prefix: cccccccccccc

To program a YubiKey in static mode, you use the -ostatic-ticket flag
as follows:

-----------
$  ./ykpersonalize -1 -ofixed=cccccccccccc -a00000000000000000000000000000000 -ostatic-ticket
Firmware version 1.3.1 Touch level 9856 Program sequence 11

To program a YubiKey in static mode with a strongly looking password
(i.e., also containing numeric and upper case letters), you use the
-ostatic-ticket flag together with -ostrong-pw1 and -ostrong-pw2 (note
YubiKey 2.0 only!) as follows:

-----------
$  ./ykpersonalize -1 -ofixed=cccccccccccc -a00000000000000000000000000000000 -ostatic-ticket -ostrong-pw1 -ostrong-pw2
Firmware version 2.0.0 Touch level 1792 Program sequence 3
Configuration data to be written to key configuration 1:

fixed: m:cccccccccccc
uid: h:000000000000
key: h:00000000000000000000000000000000

Alternatively on a YubiKey 2.0, you can program the second configuration, which
defaults to be the static key configuration:

-----------
$  ./ykpersonalize -2 -ofixed=cccccccccccc -a00000000000000000000000000000000
Firmware version 2.0.0 Touch level 1792 Program sequence 3
Configuration data to be written to key configuration 2:

fixed: m:cccccccccccc
uid: h:000000000000
key: h:00000000000000000000000000000000

To program a YubiKey with a lock code (to prevent others from easily
reprogramming it), you use the -oaccess= flag as follows:

-----------
$ ./ykpersonalize -1 -ofixed=vvvecdcedvjj -a00000000000000000000000000000000 -oaccess=001100001100

-----------

To re-program a YubiKey that has a lock code set, you use the
-cXXX.. flag as follows:

-----------
$ ./ykpersonalize -1 -c001100001100 -ofixed=vvvecdcedvjj -a00000000000000000000000000000000 -oaccess=001100223300

To disable the lock code on a YubiKey, program it with a lock code set
to zeros.  For example:

-----------
$ ./ykpersonalize -1 -c001100001133 -ofixed=vvvecdcedvjj -a00000000000000000000000000000003 -oaccess=000000000000
